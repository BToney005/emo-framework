= Install project template for Android =

To create new project for Android, use project template for Eclipse.

Download the latest source distribution from http://code.google.com/p/emo-framework/downloads/list . The project template for Eclipse is in the Android-Template directory.

  * Start your Eclipse
  * Select 'File' -> 'Import' menu
  * Select 'General' -> 'Existing Projects into Workspace'
  * Choose 'Select root directory' and browse for the parent directory of the Android-Template directory.
  * Check the 'copy projects into workspace' if you want to copy them to your workspace. (Normally you may want to check it.)
  * Check the 'Android-Template' directory and press 'Finish' button

That's all!
