== constructor ==

Creates PolygonShape instance.


== set ==

 Copy vertices. This assumes the vertices define a convex polygon. It is assumed that the exterior is the the right of each edge.

== setAsBox(hx, hy, center = null, angle = null) ==

== setAsEdge(v1, v2) ==

== getVertex(index) ==

== getVertexCount ==

== setRadius(radius) ==
