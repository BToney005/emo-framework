== Will emo-framework replace [http://www.e3roid.com/ e3roid]? ==

I guess emo will not replace e3roid. Here's some comparison.

=== e3roid ===
  * works on Android only
  * for Android 2.1 and above
  * uses Java to develop your game
  * uses Java to extend the framework
  * all of the Android API can be used
  * use Eclipse IDE and Java to build your game

=== emo ===
  * works on Android and iOS
  * for Android 2.3 and above (NativeActivity)
    * this means there's no GC with emo
  * for Xcode 3.1 and above
  * uses Scripting language to develop your game
  * uses C/C++, Objective-C to extend the framework
  * emo has simple and limited API
  * use Eclipse IDE and Java to build your game for Android
  * use Xcode to build your game for iOS
    * (this means you have to buy Mac :|)

With e3roid, you can use all of the power of Java and Android. emo has
 simple API compared to Android, and unlike e3roid extending emo
by yourself may be hard because you have to play with five languages:
C, C++, Objective-C, Java and Squirrel. I created emo because I
believe simplicity is the key of future games for indies.
