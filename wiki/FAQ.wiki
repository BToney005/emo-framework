== Will emo-framework replace [http://www.e3roid.com/ e3roid]? ==

emo carried some principles from e3roid. I guess emo will not replace e3roid. Here's some comparison.

=== e3roid ===
  * works on Android only
  * Android 2.1 and above
  * uses Java to develop your game
  * uses Java to extend the framework
  * all of the Android API can be used
  * use Eclipse IDE and Java to build your game

=== emo ===
  * works on both Android and iOS
  * Android 2.3 and above (!NativeActivity)
    * this means *there's no GC with emo*
  * Xcode 3.1 and above
  * uses Scripting language to develop your game
  * uses C/C++, Objective-C to extend the framework
  * emo has simple and limited API
  * use Eclipse IDE and Java to build your game for Android
  * use Xcode to build your game for iOS
    * (this means you have to buy Mac :|)

With e3roid, you can use all of the power of Java and Android. emo has simple API compared to Android, and unlike e3roid extending emo
by yourself might be hard because you have to play with five languages: C, C++, Objective-C, Java and Squirrel. emo has simple but powerful API that you can easily write your game with it. If you would like to write a game that works on both iOS and Android, emo is your choice.
