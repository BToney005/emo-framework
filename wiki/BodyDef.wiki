= emo.physics.BodyDef =

A body definition holds all the data needed to construct a rigid body.
This class is used by via emo.physics.World#createBody.

Basically the BodyDef class implements part of the b2BodyDef API of Box2D.  The following links may help you to understand the Box2d world.

== constructor ==

Creates BodyDef instance.

== type ==

The body type: static, kinematic, or dynamic. Note: if a dynamic body would have zero mass, the mass is set to one.

== position ==

The world position of the body. Avoid creating bodies at the origin since this can lead to many overlapping shapes.

== angle ==

The world angle of the body in radians.

== linearVelocity ==

The linear velocity of the body's origin in world co-ordinates.

== angularVelocity ==

The angular velocity of the body.
