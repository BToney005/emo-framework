== constructor(gravity, doSleep) ==

Constructs a physics world with given gravity. gravity parameter is the gravity of the world vector. if doSleep equals true it improves performance by not simulating inactive bodies.

== enableContactListener ==

Enable the contact listener of the world. The onContact event callback is enabled after enabling the contact listener.

== setGravity ==

Change the global gravity vector. the first parameter is the emo.Vec2 
 instance.

== getGravity ==

Gets the global gravity vector.

== setScale ==

Sets the pixel-to-meter scale. The default scale is defined by PTM_RATIO constant that equals 32. (1 meter equals 32 pixel)

== getScale ==

Gets the pixel-to-meter scale of the world.
