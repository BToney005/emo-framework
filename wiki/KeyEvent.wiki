= KeyEvent =

*Andriod only:* emo-framework can handle key and button events. onKeyEvent is fired by the framework when user presses the key. Note that iOS users cannot handle the key event because iOS has 'Home' button that is only used to finish the application and it is not allowed to customize that behavior.

{{{
function onKeyEvent(kevent) {
  print("key event!");
}
}}}

== getAction ==

emo-framework is just the proxy that passes the key event fired by Android platform. The action parameter has the same name compared to the Android's key event.

See [http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent.html Android KeyEvent] document for details.

{{{
function onKeyEvent(kevent) {
  if (kevent.getAction() == KEYCODE_BACK) {
    print("back button is pressed!");
  }
}
}}}
